## Network Overview

The network links the **Main Campus** and **Smaller Campus**, supporting internal services and external Internet access.

### üèõÔ∏è Main Campus

| Layer            | Components           | Role                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**         | **Core Router (CR)** | Central routing hub, handles RIPv2, DHCP for Building A, and static route to the Internet. |
| **Distribution** | **DS-A, DS-B, DS-C** | Manage VLANs and aggregate traffic for each building.                                      |
| **Access**       | **AS-A, AS-B, AS-C** | Connect end-user PCs and labs.                                                             |

**Building Roles**

* **A ‚Äì Admin & Business:** Management, HR, Finance, Business Faculty.
* **B ‚Äì Academic:** Engineering, Computing, Art & Design.
* **C ‚Äì IT & Labs:** IT Dept., Student Labs, Servers (e.g., Web, DNS).

**External Router (ER):** Connects to the Internet and Smaller Campus (via WAN or VPN).

---

### Smaller Campus

* **Smaller Campus Router (SCR):** Connects to Main Campus via WAN.
* **SDS + SAS Switches:** Manage VLANs for Staff and Student Labs.

---

## Configuration Summary

### 1. IP Addressing

Each department/faculty gets its own subnet.
Use /24 for LANs and /30 for router links.

**Example:**

* Bldg A: VLAN 10‚Äì40 (Mgmt, HR, Finance, Business)
* Bldg B: VLAN 50‚Äì60 (Engg, Design)
* Bldg C: VLAN 70‚Äì80 (IT, Labs)
* Smaller Campus: VLAN 90‚Äì100 (Staff, Students)

---

### 2. Switching

* **VLANs:** Unique IDs per department.
* **Trunks:** 802.1Q trunks between access/distribution/core.
* **Routing:** Router-on-a-Stick or L3 switch for inter-VLAN traffic.
* **Security:** Disable unused ports, use port security, and enable SSH.

---

### 3. Routing

* **RIPv2:** On CR and SCR, advertise internal subnets; set LANs as passive.
* **Static Routes:**

  * CR ‚Üí default route to ER for Internet.
  * ER ‚Üí optional static host route for external email server.

---

### 4. DHCP

* **Building A and B:** Every room must have a DCHP server PC which acts as DHCP server.

  * Assigns dynamic IPs for Management, HR, Finance, and Business VLANs.

---

### External Services

* **Email Server & Internet:** Accessible via Core ‚Üí External Router ‚Üí Cloud.
